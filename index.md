**Summary:** I used MATLAB programming environment to build and train various classification models by using the given data. In the first stage, I used pre-processing to fill the missing data and check for outliers. In the second stage, data normalisation was carried out. In the stage three, I used feature selections to focus on those data features that are most likely to produce accurate results by using the Parallel Coordinates Plot. In the stage four, I used three ML classification techniques called Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN to build and train models to solve the given problem. I also evaluated each model's performance by using percentage accuracy, prediction speed, training time, and AUC. In the last stage, I used performance matrix to comapre three models and used optimisation to select the best model.

**Summary:** I used Fisher's Iris data set and used Anaconda Python jupyter notebook for coding. First, I converted the given csv file into a dataframe by using pandas. Then, I checked for missing values and dropped all NaN and NA values. I used pandas again to get meaningful statistics and showed statistical significance by using the pairplot with the help of seaborn library. Scatter diagram was also drawn by using matplotlib library. Finally, I used an unsupervised Machine Learning technique called Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering and implement it's algorithms in Python. I also used the Euclidean distance, and single linkage (minimum distance between any two points) to cluster the given data points by using Dendrogram.
