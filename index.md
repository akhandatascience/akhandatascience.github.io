**Plan of Action:** <p align="center">I used MATLAB programming environment to build and train various classification models by using the given data. In the first stage, I used pre-processing to fill the missing data and check for outliers. In the second stage, data normalisation was carried out. In the stage three, I used feature selections to focus on those data features that are most likely to produce accurate results by using the Parallel Coordinates Plot. In the stage four, I used three ML classification techniques called Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN to build and train models to solve the given problem. I also evaluated each model's performance by using percentage accuracy, prediction speed, training time, and AUC. In the last stage, I used performance matrix to comapre three models and used optimisation to select the best model.</p>
